PLEASE NOTE:

Developer Mode is now a Rack middleware.

RPM Developer Mode is no longer available in Rails 2.1 and earlier.
However, starting in version 2.12 you can use Developer Mode in any
Rack based framework, in addition to Rails.  To install developer mode
in a non-Rails application, just add NewRelic::Rack::DeveloperMode to
your middleware stack.

Refer to the README.md file for more information.
