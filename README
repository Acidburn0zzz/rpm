SELDON
======

Seldon is the placeholder name for a rails application performance monitoring system, currently under early development by Lewis Cirne.

The Seldon Agent is installed as a Rails plugin.  Configuration is trivial: simply edit a couple of properties in RAILS_ROOT/config/seldon.yml.  When enabled, the Seldon Agent will send performance metrics about your rails application to the Seldon web site, which will collect this data and present it to you for your analysis.  The Seldon Agent is designed to be extremely lightweight, and yields exceptionally deep and useful performance information at a very low response time and CPU overhead.
